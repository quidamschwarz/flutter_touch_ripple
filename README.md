### Customizable touch ripple for flutter widget

This Flutter package allows developer to customize most of the behaviors and animations, with excellent performance and a touch effect package that can be controlled externally.

`In conclusion, using this package enables easy definition of flexible touch behaviors or touch animation.`

## How to apply ripple widget

Please referance to this code!

```dart
TouchRipple(
    onTap: () => print('Hello World!'),
    child: ... // <- this your widget!
),
```

Referance to the appropriate code to implement page movement with this code

```dart
TouchRipple(
    onTap: () {
        HapticFeedback.selectionClick();
        onTap?.call();
    },
    // or behavior
    tapBehavior: const TouchRippleBehavior(
        // "The spread animation must complete in order for the registered
        // event callback function to be called." which is equivalent to defining
        eventCallBackableMinPercent: 1,
    ),
);
```

## Apply eventCallBackableMinPercent = 1
When defining the argument ___eventCallBackableMinPercent___ of the above [TouchRippleBehavior] to be 1, we can implement a behavior to move the page after the touch ripple effect is complete.
